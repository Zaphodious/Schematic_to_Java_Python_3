JaJo_11's Structure to Java Converter
#####################################

How do I use this program?

Download the program from http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2645833-jajo-11s-schematic-to-structure-converter/ and extract it run Schematic_to_Java_Python_3.exe ignore the MainWindow.exe it is required for the program but doesn't do anything when you execute it.

What does this program do?

It converts .schematic files created by mcedit or any other program into a Java class. The class makes it possible to spawn the structure saved in the schematic as an dungeon in Minecraft.

I want to add a feature to the program what do I need to do?

Make sure that you have Python 3 (3.4) and a Python 3.4 compatible version of pyside installed. Good Luck!
You can get the source from the portal post! (<- ignore this if you are on GitHub)

Problems witch could appear:

Newer versions actually support .schematics with modded blocks if you still run into problems follow the istructions below.
The program does not support .schematics with modded blocks try to replace them with vanilla blocks first and then use search and replace on the outputted file to make them modded blocks again.

I have a problem with your program. Where I can get help?
